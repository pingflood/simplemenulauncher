SimpleMenuLauncher
==================

Here's a simple launcher that can launch apps (including emulators).
Right now, it's fairly primitive... You can scroll through a list of files (taken from a text file)
and execute them according to their own settings.

Scroll through the 2 other categories

Add another category for settings

Add support for the brightness button (adjustable brightness)


Ticked off the list

TV Out support

SD Card mounting

USB mounting

Add file browser for emulators (That took me a while but it's mostly done)
