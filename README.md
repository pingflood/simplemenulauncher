SimpleMenuLauncher
==================

Here's a simple launcher that can launch apps (including emulators).

Right now, it's fairly primitive... 

You can scroll through a list of files (taken from a text file) and execute them according to their own settings.

TODO
====

Add another category for settings (Might not get added)

Add support for user-set overclocking (Not trivial)
