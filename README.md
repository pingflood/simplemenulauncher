SimpleMenuLauncher
==================

Here's a simple launcher that can launch apps (including emulators).

Right now, it's fairly primitive... 

You can scroll through a list of files (taken from a text file) and execute them according to their own settings.


TODO
====

- Fix wallpapers
For some strange reasons, it will not print my string to the file ???

- Favorite category (suggestions made by users)
It will be another category, except that users can add entries to the favorite category via the GUI.

- Delete stuff ?
I'll probably not add it because it will lead to bug reports about "missing" apps or finding a way to recover them.
Plus, each update to the SimpleMenuLauncher will recover those back anyway.
Maybe we would need a nuke button for favorites at least in Settings.
